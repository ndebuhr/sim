//! The input modeling module provides a foundation for configurable model
//! behaviors, whether that is deterministic or stochastic.  The module
//! includes a set of random variable distributions for use in atomic models,
//! a system around "thinning" for non-stationary model behaviors, and a
//! structure around random number generation.
